This directory contains the contiki driver for the sensors (switches and potentiometer) available on the 
NXP DR1199 board. This board is part of the NXP JN516x Evaluation Kit (see http://www.nxp.com/documents/leaflet/75017368.pdf). 

The dr1199 sensor code interfaces to contiki core\lib\sensors.c framework.
The code is specificaly for the JN516X platform, because it makes use of the platform\DK4 libraries 
of this JN516X SDK.
examples\rich\dr1199-node.c shows an example on using this contiki driver.
